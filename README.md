# booking-app
this app is made for booking tickets in a conference
user can input their name
the number of tickets they are booking
choose the city in which conference is being held

used in this code:
- slices
- maps
- structs
- for loop
- if/else condition state
- funcs
- package level variables
- global level function

also putted getting user input function in other folder to try to export it and import in main package

not really confident in using map over struct as the second one is more practical and precise
